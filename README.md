This program converts MIPS assembly into machine language. It receives a set of instructions, in MIPS assembly, and checks dictionaries to see if each instruction is an I or R type encoding problem. It then checks what type of register is being called in the statement and makes the correct conversion based on the result. Lastly, it checks what is being called again to correctly place the conversions.
